# Book-Planet
Book Planet is an online platform at the institutional level which is based on the idea that used, old books should never be sold in scrap, rather can be reused. Hence an effective method of buying and selling books. The front-end is implemented using HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, jQuery and back-end is using PHP and SQL database.
